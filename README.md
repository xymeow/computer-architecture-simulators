# Computer Architecture Simulators

Here are some simulators I wrote for the course Computer Architecture at USTC.

## Cache simulator

Written in Java

## Tomasulo simulator

Written in Javascript(ES6), you can see a live demo [here](https://xymeow.github.io/computer-architecture-simulators/tomasulo_simulator/)

## Cache coherence simulators

Written in JS(ES6), simulate a system with 4 CPUs, including directory-based protocol and bus-snooping protocol.

[Here](https://xymeow.github.io/computer-architecture-simulators/cache_coherence_simulators/snoopingindex) is demo for bus-snooping protocol

[Here](https://xymeow.github.io/computer-architecture-simulators/cache_coherence_simulators/dirindex) is demo for directory-based protocol
